Input (samplesheet) schema
==========================

The documentation below is automatically generated from the schema. The JSON
file contains additional technical detail not shown in the table below.

Each row in a samplesheet can only have a single genomic data format (i.e. they
are mutually exclusive). This reference is helpful if you want to:

- Use the JSON input format (instead of CSV samplesheets) and validate the
  structure of your JSON
- Deeply understand samplesheet data structure

**But this schema probably isn't very helpful for most users, so it's OK to ignore it!**

.. jsonschema:: ../../assets/schemas/target_genomes.json
