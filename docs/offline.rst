Offline usage
=============

You might want to run this pipeline without internet access, for example in a
`trusted research environment`_. The workflow needs to download containers or
software packages from the internet, so some extra work is required.

The nf-core project has `excellent instructions`_ for running nextflow workflows
offline. For some reason ``nf-core download`` is broken at the minute |:thinking:|
