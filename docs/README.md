# pgscatalog/pgsc_calc: Documentation

The pgscatalog/pgsc_calc documentation is split into the following sections:

1. [Installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)
    * Although this pipeline uses the `nf-core` framework it's not an official `nf-core`
  workflow. The instructions to install and configure nextflow are the same.
2. [Running the pipeline](usage.md)
3. [Output and how to interpret the results](output.md)
4. [Troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting)
    * The `nf-core` troubleshooting is helpful, but if you need more help please
  open a Github issue on the pgscatalog/pgsc_calc repository. nf-core won't be
  able to help you!
