Hi! Thanks for using the PGS Catalog calculator (`pgsc_calc`). 

If you need help with setting up the calculator, configuration options, or have questions about polygenic risk scores generally, the best place to ask is:

* GitHub discussions: https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc/discussions

We prefer a public discussion forum instead of answering emails, so other people interested in PGS can find and learn from our discussions.

We also include answers to a lot of questions that get regularly asked in our documentation 
 
* Documentation: https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
